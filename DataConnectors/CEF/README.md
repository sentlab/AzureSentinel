# Common Event Format 
Common Event Format (CEF) is an industry standard format on top of Syslog messages, used by many security vendors to allow event interoperability among different platforms. By connecting your CEF logs to Azure Sentinel, you can take advantage of search & correlation, alerting, and threat intelligence enrichment for each log.

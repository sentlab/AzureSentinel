To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias CitrixADCEvent and load the function code or click [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/Citrix%20ADC/Parsers/CitrixADCEvent.txt), this function maps Citrix ADC (former NetScaler) events to Advanced Security Information Model [ASIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/normalization). The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update. \n\n>**NOTE:** 2. This parser requires a watchlist named **`Sources_by_SourceType`** with fields **`SourceType`** and **`Source`**.

For more information see: [How to Apply Elite Intelligence to Microsoft Azure Sentinel](https://www.recordedfuture.com/microsoft-azure-sentinel-integration)


# Use cases
The playbooks provided in the Recorded Future Solution support use cases for detection and incident response. Automation of a complete use case will require installation of playbooks, creation of analytic rules, and configuration of automation rules. 
## Detection - Risk list 

The TI-Processor pulls configured risk lists from Recorded Future and writes the contained indicators to Sentinels ThreatIntelligenceIndicator table in batches via the RecordedFuture-ImportToSentinel playbook.

# Risk lists
Risk lists are lists of high risk indicators matching some specific criteria. We use these lists to transfer accurate and current threat intelligence to Microsoft Sentinel as ThreatIntelligenceIndicators. Connect logs from your infrastructure in order to detect, prevent and triage security vulnerabilities.

# Prerequisites

## Roles and Permissions

The following article describes roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel [Roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/roles).

To install and manage Playbooks/Logic Apps, the following permissions are required on the resource group [Microsoft Sentinel Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#microsoft-sentinel-contributor) + [Logic App Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#logic-app-contributor).

The Threat Intelligence Platforms Data Connector in Sentinel must be enabled in order for indicators to be forwarded from the Graph Security API to Sentinel.

![](Images/2023-04-19-16-28-20.png)

## Connector authorization 
Each connector need to be authorized after playbook/logic app installation. Expand all nodes in the logic app after installation and look for blocks marked with a warning sign. Open and authorize all connections.

The Recorded Future solution uses the following connectors:
- **/recordedfuturev2** - [Microsoft power platform connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/recordedfuturev2/). All logic apps require APIKeys to communicate with the Recorded Future API. To obtain APIKeys, please visit [Recorded Future Requesting API Tokens](https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411077373587-Requesting-API-Tokens)(Require Recorded Future Login) and request API token for Recorded Future for Microsoft Sentinel.
- **/microsoftgraphsecurity** - [Documenation on Microsoft power platform connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/microsoftgraphsecurity/)
- **/azuresentinel** - [Documentation on Microsoft power platform connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/azuresentinel/)
- **/recordedfuturesandbo** - [Microsoft power platform connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/recordedfuturesandbo/). All logic apps require APIKeys to communicate with the Recorded Future API. To obtain APIKeys, please visit [Recorded Future Requesting API Tokens](https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411077373587-Requesting-API-Tokens) (Require Recorded Future Login) and request API Token for Recorded Future Sandbox for Microsoft Sentinel. 

## Ingestion and Operational costs
Playbook(Logic apps) may result in additional ingestion or operational costs:

1. [Usage metering, billing, and pricing for Azure Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing)

1. [Azure Monitor Logs cost calculations and options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs)

Recorded Futures risk lists are generated at different cadences as described in this support article [Risk List Download Recommendations](https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010401968-Risk-List-Download-Recommendations) (Require Recorded Future Login). It is possible to adjust cadence to decrease cost of data processing.

# Installation

There are two options for installing playbooks and starting automated threat response:

- Installing the solution from [Content Hub](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/GalleryItemDetailsBladeNopdl/dontDiscardJourney~/true/id/recordedfuture1605638642586.recorded_future_sentinel_solution). (Recommended)

- Installing the playbooks one by one by from this Readme.

> **Due to internal dependencies, please deploy and activate the ImportToSentinel playbook before any of the IndicatorProcessor/TIProcessor playbooks.**

## Content Hub Installation

1. Locate the Recorded Future Solution in the Content Hub.
![](Images/2023-04-18-08-39-58.png)
1. Press **Install** and then **Create** and continue to configure the solution. 
![](Images/2023-04-18-08-43-42.png)
1. If the installation was completed successfully, you will now have Workbook templates, Automation Playbook templates and Analytic Rules templates.

To use the workbooks, playbooks and analytic rules, install them inside of Sentinel by selecting the respective template and install/activate/create. 

## Playbooks one by one installation
To install individual playbooks one by one, use the buttons next to the descriptions of the individual playbooks further down in this document.

# Configuration 
## Risk list configuration 
Verify that the **ImportToSentinel** logic app is installed and active in your environment before installing the TIProcessing risk lists.
![](Images/2023-04-18-11-00-01.png)

From Automation -> Playbook Template -> Select any Recorded Future playbook that ends with TIProcessor, like **RecordedFuture-IP-Actively_Comm_C2_Server-TIProcessor**, press create playbook.
Note that it is possible to deploy several instances of the same template by giving them unique names. 

![](Images/2023-04-19-16-49-53.png)

The parameter PlaybookNameBatching is the name of the ImportToSentinel playbook that will handle batch processing of indicators into Sentinel. In the last step press **Create and continue to designer**.
![](Images/2023-04-19-16-51-12.png)

In the designer, locate all steps that show a warning and authenticate these steps. Authentication looks different for each connection. More information on this can be found in the chapter above called Connector Authorization.

![](Images/2023-04-18-14-39-40.png)

## Configure cadence of Risk list ingestion 
The first step of all TIProcessing Playbooks is a recurrence step, it is possible to adjust the cadence by modifying the interval and frequency parameters.
![](Images/2023-04-18-14-52-32.png)

If you do so however, it is critical that you also adjust the expirationDateTime parameter in the final block of that logic app to be synchronized with the recurrence timing. Failure to do so can result in either:
* Duplication of indicators.
* Having no active Recorded Future indicators the majority of the time. 

If you are unsure of how to do this, please consult Recorded Future Professional Services.

## Query Risk lists
After successfully importing one or more risk lists it is possible to query the imported data in your Log Analytics Workspace. 

Example queries:  
``` sql 
ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
| where Description contains "Recorded Future"
| take 10

ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
|where Description == "Recorded Future - IP - Actively Communicating C&C Server"
| take 10

ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
|where Description == "Recorded Future - IP - Actively Communicating C&C Server" and AdditionalInformation contains "Cobalt Strike"
| take 10
```

![](Images/2023-04-18-16-39-00.png)

## Configure Analytic Rules for detection 
The Solution contains examples of how to build Analytic Rules based on Recorded Future Risk Lists. 
![](Images/2023-04-18-16-46-44.png)

Provided the example you have to adjust the KQL query to match Threat Intelligence indicators with logs from your infrastructure.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FRecorded%2520Future%2FPlaybooks%2FRecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment-IP_Domain_URL_Hash%2Fazuredeploy.json)
[![Deploy to Azure Gov](https://aka.ms/deploytoazuregovbutton)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Sentinel%2Fmaster%2FSolutions%2FRecorded%2520Future%2FPlaybooks%2FRecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment-IP_Domain_URL_Hash%2Fazuredeploy.json)

### Automate Incident Enrichment
After one of the enrichment playbooks is installed and all connections are configured. Create an automation rule to automate the enrichment process. This will automate  enrichment of Recorded Future intelligence to known entities in all incidents. 

![](./RecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment-IP_Domain_URL_Hash/images/CreateAutomationRuleMenu.png)<br/>

In Sentinel, go to Automation and create **Automation rule**. Give the new rule a name, select the trigger **When incident is created**, select the action **Run playbook** and finally select **RecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment-IP_Domain_URL_Hash** or **RecordedFuture-Sandbox_Enrichment-Url** as the playbook. 

![](./RecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment-IP_Domain_URL_Hash/images/CreateAutomationRule.png)<br/>

This will trigger the Recorded Future playbook to run when any incident is created. Recorded future will then enrich the incident if it contains entities of types IP, Domain, Url or FileHash. 

### Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud Configuration
The Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud aggregates data related to Sigma Rules and other indicators, driving collective insights to better identify threats. Anonymized, unattributable data is collected for analytical purposes to identify trends and insights with the Intelligence Cloud. The **RecordedFuture-IOC_Enrichment-IP_Domain_URL_Hash** playbook gives end users the ability to contribute collective insights to the Intelligence Cloud.
